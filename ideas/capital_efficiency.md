## **1. Define the “Multiplier” You’re Optimizing**

If by multiplier you mean **effective directional exposure per unit capital or per unit theta**, you can formalize it as:

\text{Exposure Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Beta-weighted Dollar Delta (or Gamma-adjusted exposure)}}{\text{Net Daily Theta Cost}}

Variants:



- Use **Gamma-scaled Delta** for short-term directional bets (to account for convexity).
- Normalize by **capital at risk** or **margin requirement** instead of just theta.

This becomes a *position filter*: you select trades with the highest exposure efficiency score.

## **2. Position Sizing Using “Delta per Theta” (and Variants)**

Pro traders sometimes look at:

- **Δ/Θ ratio**: How much directional exposure you get per unit daily decay.
- **Vega/Θ ratio** for volatility plays.
- Adjust Δ/Θ for **Gamma risk**: A position with huge gamma might have a good ratio today but flip against you fast.
- Adjust Δ/Θ for **expected move alignment**: Weight by probability of underlying moving enough to offset decay.



## **3. Portfolio Construction Workflow**

1. **Universe & Signal** – Identify underlyings with a directional edge (fundamental, technical, quant).

2. **Structure Selection** – For each, model multiple option structures (ATM call, OTM call, call spread, calendar, diagonal). Compute:

   

   - Beta-weighted Δ
   - Γ, Vega
   - Θ (daily cost)
   - Margin requirement

   

3. **Efficiency Ranking** – Rank by Δ/Θ (or Δ% per unit margin). Disqualify structures that breach risk or liquidity filters.

4. **Allocation** – Allocate capital so no single underlying’s β-weighted Δ > X% of portfolio, and keep sector/index exposure balanced.





## **4. Execution Layer**

- **Stagger expirations** – So not all theta burns at once, and you can adjust gradually.
- **Ladder entries** – Add exposure on pullbacks or when implied vol is favorable, rather than all at once.
- **Directional conviction scaling** – Size Δ larger for high-conviction ideas, smaller for “exploratory” bets.



## **5. Risk Management Techniques**

**Diversification:**



- Across underlyings (reduce idiosyncratic gap risk).
- Across expirations (smooth theta bleed).
- Across vol regimes (some long vega, some short vega).

**Scenario Analysis:**



- Spot shocks: ±5%, ±10% moves

- Volatility shocks: ±5–10 IV points

- Time shifts: 7 days forward

  You want P&L surfaces that don’t have catastrophic pockets.

**Hedging:**



- Dynamic delta hedging when wrong on direction but still want to keep optionality.
- Gamma scalping to offset theta decay in high gamma positions.
- Overlay protective index puts if portfolio short gamma.



## **6. Advanced Metrics to Track**





- **Theta-to-Notional**: daily cost as % of notional exposure — keeps decay proportional.
- **Gamma-per-Theta**: for short-term bets, shows convexity gain potential per unit decay.
- **Effective Leverage**: β-weighted Δ$ / Portfolio equity.
- **Decay-Adjusted Sharpe**: (Expected return – θ cost) / Volatility.

## **7. Tools / Models That Help**





- **Risk Navigator**-style heatmaps: spot change × vol change → P&L grid.
- **Options backtesters** that can filter for best Δ/Θ historically given your signal.
- **Position scanners** that rank all available strikes/expiries by your efficiency metric.

If you want, I can write you a **Python notebook** that:



- Pulls your IB portfolio
- Computes β-weighted Δ$, Γ, Θ for each position
- Calculates Δ/Θ ratios and ranks positions
- Suggests reallocations to maximize exposure efficiency subject to diversification constraints
